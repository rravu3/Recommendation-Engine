Recommendation Engine 0.1
=============================

My goal is to build a simple recommendation engine where anyone can play with their datasets.
Though I have tested it on Movielens dataset of 1 million ratings, I don't think the current
version will be able to process any realistic size dataset. The reason I think is that all the
data that is the ratings and user and movie information is stored in the memory. 

If you find any issues, Please do email me at rahulravu96@gmail.com

Input Format
============================

The input format for the recommendation engine is of the form:-
user_id,item_id,rating,timestamp

the separator can be anything and the timestamp attribute is optional.

It is assumed that the user range from 1 to n and the items range
from 1 to m
